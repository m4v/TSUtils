Compiling
---------

This project picks its references for a local directory for avoid commiting the 
absolute path of library files into the repository. So if you want this project 
to find its references without changing any project files you have create a 
local directory named `Libraries` and copy (or symlink) the directory `Managed` 
from a KSP install and `Toolbar.dll` from blizzy78's toolbar mod.

  Libraries\
    Managed -> ${KSP_DIR}/KSP_Data/Managed
    Toolbar.dll -> ${KSP_DIR}/GameData/000_Toolbar/Toolbar.dll
